st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less by suckless forked by me.



I patched support for scollback, transparency and colorschemes


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install
